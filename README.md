# WORLDREP: A Dataset for Forecasting Future International Events

> ðŸš€ **[Dataset on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Daehoon/WORLDREP)**  

WORLDREP (**WORLD Relationship and Event Prediction**) is a high-quality dataset designed for predicting future international events based on textual information, such as news articles. It provides labeled relationships between countries with confidence scores ranging from **0.0 (cooperation)** to **1.0 (conflict)**.

This dataset is introduced and detailed in the following paper:  
[**Forecasting Future International Events: A Reliable Dataset for Text-Based Event Modeling**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14042)

## Dataset
The WORLDREP dataset is publicly available on Hugging Face:  
[![Hugging Face Dataset](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dataset-Hugging%20Face-blue)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Daehoon/WORLDREP)

### Dataset Structure
The dataset features the following columns:
| Column       | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `EventID`    | Unique identifier for the event                                            |
| `SourceURL`  | URL of the news article reporting the event                                |
| `DATE`       | Publication date of the article in `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` format                |
| `Country1`   | The first country involved in the event                                    |
| `Country2`   | The second country involved in the event                                   |
| `Score`      | Numerical value (0.0-1.0) representing the relationship between countries. A score close to **0.0** indicates **cooperation**, while a score close to **1.0** indicates **conflict**. |
